# Maths Quiz App

Goal
To Have a Fully functioning Mental Maths Game with a scoreboard that keeps track of users and their scores

Project DoD
User can create an account, play the maths quiz, and have their score saved to a database and displayed on a scoreboard



sprint 1
- sprint 1 goal - 
create and implement game logic and database structure
Managed to clear entire sprint backlog
everything went well - no issues scaffolding database or designing the game logic.





sprint 2
- sprint 2 goal -
implement a leaderboard that keeps track of player's high scores
cleared backlog apart from formatting the display of the scorebox so that it didn't show curly braces
didnt manage my time effectively enough to be able to tidy up and debug the output of the scoreboard which created a slight setback





sprint 3
- sprint 3 goal - 
add aesthetically pleasing visuals to the app and debug anything that can crash the main game loop
cleared entire backlog
this was extremely easy - designing the UI involved very little problem solving






sprint 4 
- sprint 4 goal - 
add unit tests and refactor code to implement SOLID principles
cleared entire backlog
should have implemented both unit tests and SOLID design from the beginning of the project, shouldnt have needed to dedicate
a whoel sprint to this type of organisational / housekeeping work




sprint 5
- sprint 5 goal -
add extra functionality to the database layer of the application
didnt manage to implement extra features such as functionality that changes between addition and multiplication questions
didnt manage to implement an auto-resizing / grid system for the UI.
goals listed above were far too ambitiout to try and get done in one single sprint - needed more time, 
or should have prioritised them differently






Project Retrospective
- next time i would like to implement SOLID and TDD more effectively and from the start of the project so that i don't
have to stop the flow of what i'm working on, and go back and alter old code which is no longer fresh in my mind. implementing
these as i create my next project will save a lot of time and stress and effort.
